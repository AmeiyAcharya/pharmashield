Our project aims to utilize immutability and the ability to mint tokens offered by a blockchain to enforce accountability and mitigate drug flow into illegitimate channels. This project is the solution to the leak of drugs into illegal media due to flaws and under-the-table deals between players.

The scope of our project is broad, encompassing all aspects of the drug supply chain from manufacturing and distribution to dispensing and patient use. By utilizing a blockchain-based system, we can track the movement of drugs from the manufacturer all the way to the end user, ensuring that each step of the process is transparent and accountable.

### What We Did Right

One of the key benefits of our system is that it allows for the creation of tokens that are linked to specific batches of drugs. These tokens can be used to track the movement of drugs through the supply chain and ensure that they are only sold through legitimate channels. Additionally, the immutability of the blockchain ensures that once a transaction has been recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted, providing an unchangeable record of all drug movements.

Ultimately, our project represents a significant step forward in the fight against the illegal drug trade. By utilizing the power of blockchain technology, we can create a more transparent, accountable, and secure drug supply chain that benefits all stakeholders, from manufacturers to patients.

### Technologies We Used

- Sharedeum - To deploy the contract (Contract Address: 0x39c94486be9876aaf8f294209d58cda3740f467a)
- Solidity - To code the contract
- IPFS - To publish the source code and metadata such that it allows for easier contract adoption (debugging, auditing)
- Replit - To host the frontend (HTML5 and CSS)
- Truffle - To deploy the contracts and integrate it with the frontend
